# Power-BI---Logistics

We are process analysts and need to develop a data analysis tool for analyzing overall situation of orders and their conclusion.

Project Goals:
1. Visualize the number of orders divided by each status:
   On Time/Late/Not delivered
2. Check the TOP 5 clients performance to inspect the quantity of the services given.
3. Identify the origin of the late orders.
4. Explain the orders across the year.
